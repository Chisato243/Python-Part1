# Lecture
## Python :snake:

Today we will be learning about Python! This lab session will be more self-guided than the last, so we'll get to downloading everything pretty soon.

## *Python for Everybody*

*Python for Everybody* is a free online textbook published under the Creative Commons Licence that is a great starter and reference guide for python.  Most of the lab excersises will be based on sections of *Python for Everybody* - in fact, its a great starting reference and could contain hints to solving every excersise, should you get stuck.  It breaks down the basics of python and programming as a whole, as many of the concepts we'll cover talking about python apply to almost every programming language.  The book itself is availible for purchase if you're *really* interested in a print copy, but it available as a PDF and epub from the writer for free.  Some sections of *Python for Everybody* have been adapted from another book, *How to think like a Computer Scientist: Learning with Python* by Allen Downey, Jeff Elkner and Chris Meyers.  This book is also available for free online.

If you want to dive a little deeper into the topics you'll be learning about, read chapters 2 & 3 of *Python for Everybody*.

## Getting Startedâ„¢

Let's download the lab materials. It's fine if you don't understand exactly what's going on here; you will learn about the terminal and git soon!

1. In JupyterLab, open a Launcher and select `Terminal`
4. Type in `cd CMPINF0010`
    - Or, if you named your class folder something different, replace `CMPINF0010` with whatever you named your folder
5. Now, copy and paste this command into the terminal
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/pitt-sci-cmpinf0010/week-3.git
    ```
    - If you can't seem to paste anything, try using Ctrl+Shift+V (or Command+Shift+V)
6. You should see a new folder named `week-3` inside your class folder
